Title:
Use of send function, leading to fail if gas to high.

Proof-of-code:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-thorchain/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/THORChain_Router.sol#L152
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-thorchain/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/THORChain_Router.sol#L424

Recommendation:
Use call function instead:

(bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed.");


Title:
Costly operations inside a loop

Proof-of-concept:
Operations such as state variable updates inside a loop cost a lot of gas, are expensive and may lead to out-of-gas errors. (https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#costly-operations-inside-a-loop)

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-thorchain/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/THORChain_Router.sol#L420

Recommendations:
Optimizations using local variables are preferred.


Title:
Missing events

Proof-of-concept:
Detect missing events for critical arithmetic parameters.

Recommendations:
Emit an event


Title:
Protocol doesn't handle ERC20 tokens with decimals other than 18, leading tokens with many decimal values may cause issues due to overflow, while tokens with few decimal values may result in a loss of precision.

Proof-of-concept:
https://solodit.xyz/issues/potential-funds-locked-due-low-token-decimal-and-long-stream-duration-spearbit-locke-pdf

Code:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-thorchain/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/THORChain_Router.sol

Recommendations:
To mitigate this issue, it is recommended that the decimal values of all tokens be checked, and appropriate handling measures implemented.
Maybe add a function like this:
function getAdjustedAmount(IERC20 token, uint256 amount) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint8 decimals = token.decimals();
        return amount * (10 ** (18 - decimals));
}


Title:
Doesn't check for Handling Support For Fee on Transfer Tokens and Deflationary Tokens.

Impact:
Different ERC-20 token implementations behave differently regarding the actual amount received when transferring tokens. USDT on Ethereum, for example, can charge a fee when transferring ERC-20 tokens.
Deflationary tokens like STA, meanwhile, burn a certain percentage of the transferred amount, which subsequently decreases the token supply.
As a result, the transfer of STA and USDT, and other tokens like them, to a smart contract can result in incorrect token accounting.


Code:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-thorchain/blob/main/ethereum/contracts/THORChain_Router.sol

Recommendations:
To mitigate this issue, the contract should check the balance before and after a transfer, updating the balance of the msg.sender based on the amount subtracted for fees or burnt tokens.

function Deposit(uint256 amount) public {
    uint balance_before = token.balanceOf(address(this) 
    token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount); 
    uint balance_after = token.balanceOf(address(this); 
    require(balance_after >= balance_before );
    uint amount_to_add = balance_after â€” balance_before; 
    balances[msg.sender] += amount_to_add;

}
